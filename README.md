## File Structure and Treatment
1. For all reusable components, must be placed in `/components`
2. For all that related to pages wrapper components (container), must be placed in `/pages`
3. For utilities related such as helper functions and reusable classnames, must be placed in `/utils`
(I used utilities classname to prevent any duplicated style rules and reduce css files)

## Available Scripts

### `yarn start` or `npm start`

You will also see any lint errors in the console.

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
